## [Latest] - 2025-10-05

### üéâ Major Features Added

#### Enhanced Flamegraph Visualization
- **Statistics Panel**: Comprehensive metrics dashboard
  - Total functions, calls, execution time
  - Average time per call

- **Inline Visualization**:
  - `display_callgraph()` - Display interactive graphs in notebooks
  - Custom dimensions and layouts
  - Full interactivity

- **Full Feature Support**:
  - All tracing features work in Jupyter
  - Profiling integration

### üêõ Critical Fixes

#### CPU Profiling Fix
- **Problem**: CPU profile always showed 0.000s execution time, 0 function calls, 0 hot spots
- **Root Cause**: Profiler reference was stored but not the actual profiling data snapshot
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `cpu_profile_stats` field to store `pstats.Stats` snapshot
  - Create snapshot before profiler stops
  - Updated `_get_cpu_stats()` to use the snapshot
- **Impact**: ‚úÖ CPU profiling now shows actual execution times and accurate statistics

#### Module Filter Fix
- **Problem**: Module filter dropdown was populated but had no functionality
- **Root Cause**: No event listener attached to handle filter changes
- **Solution**:
  - Added change event listener to filter dropdown
  - Implemented node and edge filtering logic
  - Added smooth zoom animation
  - Handle empty modules as "Main Module"
- **Impact**: ‚úÖ Module filtering now works correctly with visual feedback

#### Layout Fixes
- **Problem**: Circular and Timeline layouts were not working
- **Root Cause**: Used incorrect `network.moveNode()` API which doesn't exist in vis.js
- **Solution**:
  - Replaced with proper node updates using `data.nodes.clear()` and `data.nodes.add()`
  - Fixed Circular layout with trigonometry calculations
  - Fixed Timeline layout with proper sorting by execution time
  - Added position management (fixed vs dynamic)
  - Removed duplicate layout handlers
- **Impact**: ‚úÖ All 4 layouts (Hierarchical, Force, Circular, Timeline) now work correctly

#### JSON Export Fix
- **Problem**: "network.getData is not a function" error when clicking "Export as JSON"
- **Root Cause**: `network.getData()` method is not available in vis.js networks
- **Solution**:
  - Use original `nodes` and `edges` arrays instead
  - Added detailed error handling and logging
  - Enhanced metadata structure
  - Added success feedback
- **Impact**: ‚úÖ JSON export now works reliably

#### Tracer Stability Fix
- **Problem**: Test programs would stop executing after the first few print statements
- **Root Cause**: 
  - Insufficient error handling in `_trace_calls` method
  - Conflicts between `@trace` decorator and `trace_scope` context manager
  - Missing exception handling caused silent failures
- **Solution**:
  - Enhanced error handling in `_trace_calls` with try-except blocks
  - Added filtering to skip internal callflow-tracer functions
  - Fixed `@trace` decorator integration with active trace_scope contexts
  - Improved caller name detection using `sys._getframe(3)`
  - Better global state management
- **Impact**: ‚úÖ Programs now run to completion, generating complete visualizations

### ‚ú® Enhancements

#### Enhanced HTML Exporter
- **CPU Profile Section**:
  - Collapsible section with gradient header
  - Fire emoji icon (üî•) for visual appeal
  - Hover effects and smooth transitions
  - Dark code theme for profile data
  - Toggle functionality

- **Improved UI**:
  - Modern card-based layouts
  - Professional color schemes
  - Better spacing and typography
  - Responsive design improvements

#### Flamegraph Enhancements

- Configurable dimensions (width, height)
- Minimum width threshold to hide small functions
- Better tooltip information with percentages
- Responsive window resizing
- Auto-fit functionality

#### New Features Available

**Enhanced Flamegraph**:
```python
# Old way (still works)
generate_flamegraph(graph, "output.html")

# New way (with all features)
generate_flamegraph(
    graph,
    "output.html",
    color_scheme="performance",  # NEW!
    show_stats=True,             # NEW!
    search_enabled=True          # NEW!
)
```

**Jupyter Integration**:
```python
# NEW! Use in Jupyter notebooks
from callflow_tracer.jupyter import display_callgraph

with trace_scope() as graph:
    my_function()

display_callgraph(graph.to_dict())
```

**Fixed Features**:
